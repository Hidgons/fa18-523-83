## Abstract
As the Internet of Things evolves, the needs for connectivity and communication between more complicated applications and data sources increases. Higher data volume and communication creates concerns such as data movement speeds, complex types of data sources, security, governance and high availability. Apache NiFi is an open-source software that helps resolve and address those concerns and automate the flow of data between systems.

## Keywords
fa18-523-83, Apache NiFi, dataflow 

## Introduction

Nifi is an open-source project created by the United States Security Agency(NSA), originally named *Niagarafiles* and is currently being sponsored by Hortonworks under the name of Apache Nifi project [@fa18-523-83-nifi-wiki].

Nifi’s design concepts involve around the main ideas of Flow Based Programing (FBP) – a programming paradigm that was invented by J. Paul Rodker Morrison in the late ‘60s. 

>FBP defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which communicate via data chunks (called Information Packets) travelling across predefined connections (think "conveyor belts"), where the connections are specified externally to the processes [@fa18-523-83-flowbaseprogramming-jpaulmorrison].

## NiFi Architecture


## NiFi Features

NiFi's main features are:

* Guaranteed delivery: use purpose-built persistent write-ahead log and content repository to ensure guaranteed delivery in an effective way 
* Web-based user interface: easy to use web-based GUI with drag and drop features that allows users to build, schedule, control, and monitor dataflow
* Provenance: provide ability to track data flows through the systems with audit trail and traceability functionalities 
* Queue Prioritization: provide the ability to configure and prioritize job flow and determine the order of events 
* Secure: provide and support multiple security protocols and encryptions, as well as authorization management
* Extensibility: provide flexibility by allowing pre-built and built-your-own extension the be integrated 
* Scalability: supports scale-out by clustering architecture as well as scale-up and scale-down [@fa18-523-83-nifi-apache][@fa18-523-83-apache-nifi-overview]
